# Virtual German Charter Network (VdU)

_Virtuelles Deutsches Urkundennetzwerk (VdU)_ is a DFG-funded project (2011-2013) to build up a _Virtual Research Environment_ for the handling medieval charters.

About 20.000 charters from 12 German archives contained in 35 archival fonds were scanned during the project phase and were enriched with metadata. HKI Cologne developed a set of collaborative tools for the edition and analysis of these charter collections. Read more about the tools here: [https://github.com/HKIKoeln/MOM-CA](https://github.com/HKIKoeln/MOM-CA).

In addition, a collection of 138 different chartularies from different regions of Europe were made available in cooperation with Google. The chartualries have been digitized and OCR-scanned by Google. HKI Cologne developed automatic recognition mechanisms to analyse the structure of the charter books, including signatures, abstracts, date and place of issuing, transcriptions, persons and places and so on. The structured content could then be transcoded into a standardized TEI/XML format.

Both, the content created, as well as the software tools developed have been transfered completely into the larger project [Monasterium.net](http://www.monasterium.net/) as of November 30th 2013.

All results and documentation of the VdU platform is available here: [https://github.com/HKIKoeln/MOM-CA](https://github.com/HKIKoeln/MOM-CA)
