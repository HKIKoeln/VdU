# VdU

_Virtuelles Deutsches Urkundennetzwerk (VdU)_ is a DFG-funded project (2011-2013) to build up a _Virtual Research Environment_ for the handling medieval charters.

About 20.000 charters from 12 German archives contained in 35 archival fonds were scanned during the project phase and enriched with metadata.

In addition, there is a collection of 138 different chartularies from different regions of Europe available. These have been digitized in cooperation with Google, automatically read and then prepared for the VdU platform.

Both, the content created, as well as the software tools developed have been transfered completely into the larger project [Monasterium.net](http://www.monasterium.net/) as of November 30th 2013.

All results and documentation is thus available here: [https://github.com/HKIKoeln/MOM-CA](https://github.com/HKIKoeln/MOM-CA)
