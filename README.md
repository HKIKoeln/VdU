# VdU

"Virtuelles Deutsches Urkundennetzwerk (VdU)" is a DFG-funded project (2011-2013) intended to build up a Virtual Research Environment for medieval charters.

The Virtual Research Environment provides about 20.000 charters from 35 fonds from 12 German archives. High-resolution scans of the front and back sides of the original charters are added to the majority of records. The level of detail of metadata differenciate between the fonds.

In addition, there is a collection of 138 different chartularies from different regions of Europe available. These have been digitized in cooperation with Google, automatically read and then prepared for the VdU platform.

Both, the content created, as well as the software tools developed have been transfered completely into the larger project [Monasterium.net](http://www.monasterium.net/) as of November 30th 2013.
